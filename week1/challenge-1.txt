##Challenge A: (Divisibility Sum)
The numbers below 100 that are divisible by all primes below 7 are:
30, 60 and 90. Their sum is 180.
Find the sum of all odd  numbers below 100,000 that are divisible by all primes p for 2<p<10

##Challenge B : (Sci Big Pow)
3 and 2 are the highest powers of 2 and 3 respectively that can give a result less than 10 i.e  2^3(8), 3^2(9).  We shall call these highest powers scibigpow. The product of the factorials of these scibigpow is 3! * 2! = 12.
Find the last 12 digits of the product of the factorials of the scibigpow of all numbers below 1000 that give a result  less than the largest prime below 2 million
Note: (1^n = 1 and therefore we donâ€™t include 1 in the range of numbers)

An array is said to be nested if it contains at least one array as an element. Implement an algorithm with a function/method that takes in a nested array and gives the number of arrays and number of elements as in the form (A, E) as output where A is the number of arrays and E is the number of elements.

(B) The Queens Problem

(Hint: Queens attack in all directions)

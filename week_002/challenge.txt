Challenge A: (Permuted Multiples)
It can be seen that the number, 125874, and its double, 251748, contain exactly   the same digits, but in a different order.
Find the smallest positive integer, x, such that 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x, contain the same digits.

Challenge B: (Cubic permutations)
The cube, 41063625 (3453), can be permuted to produce two other cubes:  56623104 (3843) and 66430125 (4053). In fact, 41063625 is the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube.
Find the largest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits are cube.

Challenge C: (Fibonacci word )
The word a4z47 makes a Fibonacci word sum of 1 + 5 + 196418 + 5 + 21 = 196450  by replacing all the alphabets with their equivalent positions in the alphabetical chart and taking their Fibonacci equivalent for example f is equivalent to 6 and Fibonacci(6) is 13.
